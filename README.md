C++ Black Jack Project

The goal of Black Jack is to get a card total that is closest to 21 without going over.

When you start the program, it will ask you how many players are playing. Currently, there can be a maximum of 4 players + the dealer.
The dealer will draw 2 cards. The dealer may or may not draw more cards.
Player1 will get 2 cards. Player1 will be given the option to "Stand" or "Hit". "Hit" will draw a new card while stand will end your turn.
Player2 will get 2 cards. Player2 will be given the option to "Stand" or "Hit". "Hit" will draw a new card while stand will end your turn.
Player3 will get 2 cards. Player3 will be given the option to "Stand" or "Hit". "Hit" will draw a new card while stand will end your turn.
Player4 will get 2 cards. Player4 will be given the option to "Stand" or "Hit". "Hit" will draw a new card while stand will end your turn.
After everyone has ended there turn, the player who has the highest number without going over 21 will be declared the winner.
